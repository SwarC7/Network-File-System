## Project Overview

This is an advanced distributed Network File System (NFS) implementation written entirely in C, designed to demonstrate deep understanding of distributed systems, networking, and systems programming concepts. The system provides a unified interface for storing and accessing files across multiple storage servers through a centralized naming server architecture. This project showcases proficiency in low-level networking, distributed systems design, concurrent programming, and fault tolerance mechanisms.

Key Value Propositions:

- **Distributed Systems Mastery**: Demonstrates advanced understanding of distributed systems architecture, networking protocols, and server coordination
- **Advanced C Programming**: Clean, modular architecture with proper memory management, thread safety, and error handling
- **Educational Implementation**: Comprehensive distributed file system with practical feature set
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Complex algorithmic implementations for path routing, backup synchronization, and health monitoring
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms with O(1) cache lookups and O(path_length) trie operations

## Features & Technical Highlights

### Core System Architecture

- **Distributed Server Architecture**:
  - Central naming server for metadata coordination and routing
  - Multiple storage servers for distributed file storage
  - Client interface for unified access to the distributed filesystem

- **Robust Networking Framework**:
  - TCP/IP communication between all system components
  - Multi-threaded server architecture with thread-safe operations
  - Comprehensive error handling and network timeout management

- **Intelligent File Routing**:
  - Trie-based path-to-storage-server mapping with O(path_length) operations
  - LRU cache for O(1) average path lookups to optimize performance
  - Dynamic routing of client requests to appropriate storage servers

### Custom Features

#### Naming Server - Intelligent Path-to-Server Routing

The naming server serves as the central coordinator, maintaining mappings between file paths and storage servers:

```bash
# System registers storage servers automatically
# Clients query naming server to discover file locations
# Backup synchronization is coordinated automatically
```

Implementation Details: Uses trie data structure for efficient path storage, LRU cache for performance optimization, and health monitoring for server availability tracking.

#### Storage Server - Distributed File Storage Engine

Storage servers provide actual file storage with advanced features:

```bash
# Storage server with file operations and backup
./storage_server 8080 Test/SS1

# Supports multiple operations
WRITE /path/to/file "content" SYNC     # Write with synchronous operations
READ /path/to/file                     # Read file contents
CREATE /path/to/dir 1                  # Create directory
DELETE /path/to/file 0                 # Delete file (0) or directory (1)
STREAM /path/to/audio.mp3              # Stream audio files
```

Technical Notes: Implements read/write locks for concurrent access, supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations, maintains backup copies on other servers in the cluster.

#### Client Interface - Unified Distributed File Access

The client provides a unified command-line interface for the distributed file system:

```bash
# Interactive client session
./client

# Available commands:
READ /file/path              # Read file contents from distributed system
WRITE /file/path "content"   # Write content to file
CREATE /file/path 0          # Create file (0) or directory (1)
DELETE /file/path 0          # Delete file (0) or directory (1)
COPY /src /dest 0            # Copy file (0) or directory (1)
LIST                         # List all files in the system
STREAM /audio.mp3            # Stream audio content
exit                         # Exit client
```

Architecture: Communicates with naming server for path resolution, then directly with storage servers for file operations.

#### Advanced Backup System

Automatic backup synchronization with fault tolerance:

- **Ring-based Backup Topology**: Each server maintains backups on the next two servers in a ring
- **Automatic Recovery**: Failed servers automatically sync missed data when they come back online
- **Backup Consistency**: Ensures data integrity during backup operations
- **Crash Recovery**: Asynchronous writes with temporary file support for recovery

## Technical Deep Dive

```

**Client Layer**: Command-line interface for users to interact with the distributed file system

**Naming Server Layer**: Central coordinator that maintains file path to storage server mappings using trie data structure, with LRU cache for performance optimization

**Storage Server Layer**: Multiple servers that store actual file data, handle file operations, and maintain backup copies of data

**Backup Network**: Ring-based backup synchronization ensuring fault tolerance and data availability

### Refactored Architecture

The system has been redesigned with a modular architecture where each component is separated into focused modules:

- **NamingServer Modules**:
  - **Main Module** (`ns.c`): Core logic and main function
  - **Connection Handler** (`connection_handler.c`): Client and storage server connection management
  - **Health Monitor** (`health_monitor.c`): Server health monitoring and status tracking
  - **Command Processor** (`command_processor.c`): Command parsing and execution
  - **Backup Utilities** (`backup_utils.c`): Backup synchronization utilities
  - **Core Services** (`trie.c`, `lru.c`, `log.c`, `ns_commands.c`): Fundamental services

- **StorageServer Modules**:
  - **Main Module** (`ss.c`): Core logic and main function
  - **File Operations** (`file_operations.c`): File read/write/stream and locking mechanisms
  - **Network Communications** (`network_comm.c`): Client handling and network communication
  - **Backup Synchronization** (`backup_sync.c`): Backup creation and synchronization
  - **Async Operations** (`async.c`): Asynchronous operations with crash recovery
  - **Logging** (`log.c`): Logging services

This modular design improves maintainability, testability, and enables easier enhancements to individual components.

- Standard C development libraries
- `make` utility
- `gnome-terminal` (for automated startup script with multiple windows)
- Development libraries for pthread, socket programming, and system calls

### Installation & Compilation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Network-File-System

# Compile all components using makefile
make clean && make

# Or compile manually
gcc -o naming_server NamingServer/ns.c NamingServer/log.c NamingServer/trie.c NamingServer/ns_commands.c NamingServer/lru.c Utils/errors.c -lpthread -fsanitize=address -g
gcc -o storage_server StorageServer/server_commands.c StorageServer/async.c Utils/errors.c StorageServer/log.c -lpthread -fsanitize=address -g
gcc -o client Clients/client.c Utils/errors.c -lpthread -fsanitize=address -g
```

### Running the System

#### Automated Startup with Multiple Terminals

```bash
# This will start naming server, 2 storage servers, and a client in separate terminals
./make.sh
```

#### Manual Startup (Recommended for Development)

1. Start the naming server:
```bash
./naming_server
```

2. Start storage servers in separate terminals:
```bash
./storage_server 8080 Test/SS1
./storage_server 7070 Test/SS2
./storage_server 6060 Test/SS3
```

3. Start the client:
```bash
./client
```

## Testing & Verification

After compilation and startup, test basic functionality:

```bash
# In client terminal, try the following commands:
CREATE /my_file 0          # Create a file
WRITE /my_file "Hello, distributed world!"  # Write content
READ /my_file              # Read the content
LIST                       # List all files in the system
CREATE /my_dir 1           # Create a directory
DELETE /my_file 0          # Delete the file
exit                       # Exit the client
```

Expected Output:
- Naming server should show routing logs
- Storage servers should show file operation logs
- Client should display results of operations
- All components should maintain consistent state

  - **Backup Utilities** (`backup_utils.c/h`): Backup synchronization utilities

#### 2. StorageServer Module
- **Original**: `server_commands.c` (1248 lines) was extremely large and complex
- **Completed**: Successfully decomposed into multiple focused files:

#### 3. Improved Architecture
- **Result**: Clean separation of concerns with focused modules
